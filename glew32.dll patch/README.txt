This part is optional; and while it can increase stability to your game it hasn't been tested much; so that is why it's not part of the main branches of patches and only included in the autoinstaller;

to install this just delete your glew32.dll from your munch directory and replace it with this one.

this can make your game flicker when booting but will stop after it loads.
